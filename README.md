## Overview

Large Language Models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks — specifically **Prompt Injections**, **Jailbreaks**, and **Social Engineering** attempts. This project implements a **defense-in-depth multi-agent security platform** that detects and responds to these attacks through three independent, sequential defense tiers, backed by a policy enforcement layer, session memory, and an explainable SOC-style dashboard.

The system evolved from a two-tier classifier into a full multi-agent architecture, where each layer covers the blind spots of the previous one. No single detection method is sufficient — the combination is what makes it effective.

> **All LLM inference runs locally via Ollama. No user data is sent to any external API.**

## Defense Layers

### Tier 1 — Regex Sentinel Agent

A fast, flexible NLP filter built around **verb-object pattern pairs**. Acts as the first line of defense and returns a human-readable rule label on every match.

- **26 labeled patterns** targeting specific attack intents: payload generation, instruction override, data exfiltration, filter bypass, SSRF, phishing
- **Bidirectional matching** — catches commands even when word order is reversed
- **Morphological flexibility** — handles progressive suffixes, filler words, and common misspellings
- Returns a `SentinelResult` dataclass with the matched rule label, not just a boolean
- Runs in microseconds — zero ML overhead

### Tier 2 — DistilBERT Analyst Agent

Prompts that pass Tier 1 undergo semantic analysis using a fine-tuned `distilbert-base-uncased` sequence classification model.

- **Three-zone decision system:**
  - `BLOCK` — score ≥ 0.65 (high confidence malicious)
  - `REVIEW` — score 0.30–0.65 (ambiguous, forwarded to Tier 3)
  - `ALLOW` — score < 0.30 (low confidence, logged)
- Trained on a data-centric aggregated dataset (see Datasets section)
- Weighted cross-entropy loss (malicious class 3×) to handle class imbalance
- Max sequence length: 256 tokens | Train/test split: 85% / 15%
- Returns token attention scores for explainability visualization

**Model Performance:**
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 93.68% |
| Precision | 95.83% |
| Recall | 92.00% |
| F1 Score | 93.87% |

### Tier 3 — Local Guardian AI Agent

Prompts that are not clearly resolved by Tiers 1–2 are forwarded to a locally-hosted LLM for deep intent analysis.

- **Model:** `qwen3:8b` running via **Ollama** (fully local, offline, no API key required)
- Detects subtle manipulation patterns: roleplay jailbreaks, emotional manipulation, hypothetical framing, gradual escalation, indirect injection
- Returns a **structured verdict** with four required fields:
  ```
  [GUARDIAN_VERDICT]   SAFE / SUSPICIOUS / MALICIOUS
  [SUSPICION_SCORE]    0–100
  [ATTACK_TYPE]        8-category taxonomy (see below)
  [REASONING]          Human-readable explanation
  ```
- Chain-of-thought disabled (`think=False`) to reduce latency and prevent reasoning block leakage
- Hardened system prompt with **6 absolute safety rules** — never outputs real payloads or exploit instructions

**8-Category Threat Taxonomy:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SAFE` | No threat detected |
| `SUSPICIOUS` | Ambiguous intent |
| `PROMPT_INJECTION` | Direct instruction override attempt |
| `SOCIAL_ENGINEERING` | Manipulation / deception |
| `OFFENSIVE_SECURITY` | Exploit / payload request |
| `DATA_EXFILTRATION` | Credential or data extraction attempt |
| `ROLEPLAY_JAILBREAK` | Persona hijacking / DAN-style attack |
| `POLICY_EVASION` | Indirect evasion attempt |

### Policy Enforcement Layer

A second, independent scanning layer that runs on the **Guardian's output** — not the user's input. This was added after testing revealed the LLM could occasionally generate real exploit code inside educational explanations, even with safety rules in its system prompt.

- Scans both code blocks and inline text for dangerous patterns:
  - SQL `UNION SELECT` / `DROP TABLE`
  - XSS `<script>` tags and `onerror`/`onload` handlers
  - Reverse shell strings (`nc`, `/dev/tcp/`, Python socket shells)
  - `base64` encoded execution, `rm -rf /`, `curl|bash` chains
  - Metasploit references, `/etc/passwd` paths, `document.cookie` exfiltration
- **Surgical redaction** — replaces only the dangerous string, preserving surrounding text
- Replacement format: `[⚠ POLICY ENGINE: TYPE — REDACTED FOR SAFETY]`
- Returns a `PolicyResult` dataclass tracking violation count and types

### Session Memory & Threat Escalation

The `MemoryAgent` tracks attack patterns across the session and escalates the system's response posture automatically.

- Tracks: total attack count, consecutive attacks, unique attack types, time since last attack
- **4 escalation levels:** `NORMAL` → `SUSPICIOUS` → `PARANOID` → `MAXIMUM THREAT`
- Higher escalation levels modify the Guardian's system prompt for more aggressive analysis

## Explainable AI Features

Every decision in the pipeline is traceable:

- **Token attention heatmap** — shows which tokens the DistilBERT model focused on (3-level fallback: attention weights → embedding L2 norms → uniform scores)
- **Safe vs. Malicious confidence bars** — live percentage display for every interaction
- **Tier transparency** — which tier triggered, the exact regex rule label, ML score, Guardian reasoning, and policy violations are all shown explicitly
- **7-row telemetry panel** — tier triggered, score, attack type, regex rule, escalation level, inference time, redaction count

---

## SOC-Style Dashboard

The Streamlit interface is designed around a Security Operations Center aesthetic.

- **Single-interaction navigation** — `← PREV / NEXT →` buttons instead of a scrolling chat history, for easier review during demos or investigations
- **3-column pipeline status cards** — T1 / T2 / T3 result at a glance
- **Color-coded threat category chip** per interaction
- **Sidebar:** session metrics (total prompts, blocked, redacted), Ollama health status, local inference time, interaction history log
- **Red Team mode** — gamified attack scoring
- Pulsing `LOCAL INFERENCE` badge — visual confirmation that no data leaves the machine

---

## Datasets Used

The DistilBERT model was trained on an aggregated, balanced dataset combining real-world attack examples with large benign corpora to minimize false positives on technical queries.

**Malicious (Label 1):**
- [deepset/prompt-injections](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepset/prompt-injections) — foundational manipulation tactics
- [Prompt Injection in the Wild (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arielzilber/prompt-injection-in-the-wild) — real-world adversarial attack variety

**Benign (Label 0):**
- [yahma/alpaca-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned) — general non-malicious interactions
- [sahil2801/CodeAlpaca-20k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sahil2801/CodeAlpaca-20k) — software engineering and database queries (critical for avoiding false positives on technical text)

## About This Project

This project was developed as a university project in AI and cybersecurity, focusing on LLM security, adversarial machine learning, and defense-in-depth architectures. The system evolved from a simple binary classifier into a full multi-agent platform as each layer's limitations became clear during development and testing.
